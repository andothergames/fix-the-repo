          Welcome to the world of dinosaurs! Dinosaurs, the fascinating giants
          that once roamed our planet, have captured imaginations for
          generations. These reptiles first appeared during the Triassic period,
          approximately 230 million years ago, and dominated life on Earth
          throughout the Mesozoic Era, which lasted until around 66 million
          years ago. The Mesozoic is often divided into three periods: Triassic,
          Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Throughout these epochs, dinosaurs evolved
          into an incredible diversity of species, ranging from the towering,
          long-necked Brachiosaurus to the nimble, feathered Velociraptor.
